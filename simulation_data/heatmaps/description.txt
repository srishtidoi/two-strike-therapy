This directory contains simulation data for extinction probability heatmaps
when varying the following environmental and demographic conditions:

1) Treatment level (D1=D2, therapy)
2) Cost of resistance (c, cost)
3) Carrying capacity (K)
4) Birth rate (b)
5) Death rate (d)

Each directory contains several subdirectories with data for different 
values of the parameter of interest. The file 'config.txt' lists the 
values of this parameter, the switching point and the corresponding subdirectory.

Each subdirectory contains 2 files:

2) 'results.txt': result of 500 independent runs (before-nadir extinction 
   probability, progression probability and persistence probability). 
3) 'params.csv'
